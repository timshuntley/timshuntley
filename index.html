      My name is <span itemprop="name"><b>Tim Huntley</b></span>. I’m 57 years old, live in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with my wife, Jenny, and our twin boys, Neil and Evan.
      <p>I was raised in Union County, North Carolina where I was the classic computer geek.  Math and science came easy, and my interest in computers led to a clear-cut decision on what I wanted to study in college.  So in 1985, I packed my bags and headed for <span itemprop="alumniOf">NC State University in Raleigh</span>.</p>
      <p>After college and eager to make my mark, I went to work for IBM, but I discovered that a big company environment wasn’t right for me.  Thankfully, I made some great friends who were much smarter, and we left IBM in 1995 to start our own company, Ganymede Software.  Over the course of the next five years, we raised money from venture capitalists, grew to over 100 people, and sold the company to NetIQ in early 2000.  You can read more about that part of my life
